> How I started out with a goal on making the world a better place with AI, my initial plan and my first steps in the AI landscape.

## The Plan
I started out not really knowing how I'm even going to approach it. 

**So far I had learned that 3 fundamental principles for learning are**:
- Everything is a game - it is a choice to learn
- Feymen technique - if you can teach it to others you have actually learned it
- Trunk based learning - learn the fundamental things, which are stable and will serve you for the long term

With this in mind I started to do a bit of research. Soon I found out that **a good place to start would be**: 
1. **Understand What AI Is** *(at least the definition..)*
2. **Explore the Main Areas of AI**
	- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI where machines learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, they improve their performance based on experience.
	- **Deep Learning**: A type of ML involving neural networks with many layers, which are particularly good at recognising patterns in large amounts of data.
	- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: A branch of AI focused on enabling machines to understand and respond to human language.
	- **Computer Vision**: This area involves teaching machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data (like images and videos).
3. **Learn Some Basic Terms along the way**
	- There just are so much terms used for so many things.. good idea is to make some flashcards to keep up with all of that. 
4. **Get Hands-On**
	- **Python programming** - "The chosen language" for AI and ML community
	- Online courses

### Daily Learning Structure - 1st week

The general understanding of above mentioned things will not change drastically *(\*specific implementations might)* so with that in mind I created a **daily structure to follow**:
- **1h Learn Python programming** 
	- Only create projects and get help from ChatGPT as much as possible asking to suggest project ideas and do core reviews
- **1h Understanding AI basics**, concepts & looking for a course to take
- **45min Exploring AI landscape / new tools** *(at the beginning I did not have time or energy for this)*

### Learning on ZTM - 2nd week onwards

I did the above for one week to realise I definitely need some sort of online course to get me bootstrapped. I had some good experience in the past with ZTM courses and it turns out they have created a [career-path](https://zerotomastery.io/career-paths/become-a-machine-learning-engineer/) for new A.I. & Machine Learning Engineers. 

The first course in the career path is "Complete A.I. and Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp". At that point I was not committed to ZTM so much that I would buy their subscription, but fortunately they have the same course [on the Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery) as well. Udemy always have sales campaigns running and I bought the course for 18 EUR, pretty good price if you ask me. 

> fyi. there is always new customers discount for Udemy, so if you don't see the discount just create a new account in the incognito tab and you should be good to go

### New Daily Learning Structure

With this also my **daily learning structure changed**:
- 30m Python programming (on projects)
- 12 ZTM course lectures
- Review flashcards

I shift my focus heavily on the ZTM course as I see It's value. In the same time I stated to create flashcards for the knowledge and terminology used in the course and review them using spaced repetition. 

And I did 12 lectures a day because I had a plan to finish in 43 days, because after that I had planned a hiking trip.

> If you want to set a realistic goal for finishing the course do the following: get the total of all the lectures/videos/materials in the course divide that by the number of days you plan to study (I excluded sundays and few other days - you must have rest days..) and you come up with a number.  **In the course there are 386 lessons, so for me it was 386/32 = ~12**

So when you get the number, try it out couple of days, see how it feels, adjust it needed. 

## Results (~40days in)
I had been going for 40 days *(I finished ZTM course earlier because I learned python in parallel and I did not need extra python lectures which were provided on the course)*.

**So far I've done:** 
- Plan and personalise my learning path
- Learned some basic python, while creating some small projects, todo lists, calculators, CRUD
- Finished ZTM course
	- Learned general terminology used in ML
	- Created real world applicable projects 
		- Heart disease detection based on patient medical records *(classification problem)*
		- Bulldozer price prediction based on bulldozer parameters and sale date *(regression problem)*
		- Dog breed detection using Tensorflow *(image multi-class classification problem)*
	- Learned some useful libraries and tools: Pandas, NumPy, ScikitLearn, Tensorflow
	- Joined ZTM community on the Discords *(good stuff, find friends, stay motivated)*
- Created a Rock/Paper/Scissor game with an AI opponent *(multi-class classification problem)*

### Conclusion
My first 40 days on the AI adventure seemed to fly by super fast and I ended up in the all well known state when you have done so much, you know something, and you realise that you *actually* know very little when you look at the whole AI landscape. 

I had the exact feeling, that there I was, I had learned something and yet nothing that I can say that I know for sure, as there is so much more to learn about every single thing I learned in the course. Each new AI tool, generator, course coming out every day also did not made the feeling any better. So, stay tuned for the second chapter on the AI adventure.
